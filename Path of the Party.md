Starting in Townsville, Chökland the party met at the local tavern, where they found an old ragtag dog. They took the dog then proceeded to return to the tavern for rest throughout their time in the town. (The tavern keep never noticed his dog was missing) The party finished a few quests to gain some levels and went into a dungeon near Townsville, inside the dungeon The Marauder Test Died and The Marauder was acting as a guide and so, he joined the party.

The adventuring party eventually took a quest to kill the lizards, they went and killed the lizards, but not before Jim Kimbop got railed by many of them. Then the party left and made their way south towards the port of Chökland, where they set off towards the death Isles.

On the way to the Death Isles the party encountered Ebstines Island, we don't talk about that. The only important thing is the party got a sword from a kids femur after a giant tome was called down onto a child, and a list of names (Shroomy, Jim, Nadarr) eas taken from the island.

The party continued, where they found the Oros. A bastions was set up there and a teleportation circle was connected to the boat.

Eventually they eventually made it to the death Isles. Where they crossed 7 island, each one getting more and more dangerous, except for the last one. Here Thrum Skullhew died after shredding a black dragon. Also the new member joined, Clanker (Subject 00).

After a quick nap from Jim Kimbop (Dream and 4 new items) the part set off again where they found an extra island, looted it quick then left.

After a short stop at a SCP island and a battle of wits with a bird we are back on the boat.
On the boat Shroomy annoys John Pork and she jumps off, she lands on the deck with no problems. Jim Kimbop fell into the water as a bird and expands his neck into a trampoline to float.

Afterwards the party makes it onto an island which turns out to be a giant cyclops skull which we the n need to fight. We barely defeat it, 2 death and 5 hp total remaining. The party then makes it back to the surface and onto the boat, Jim Kimbop and Clanker then spar and Clanker wins by sheer luck 2 times. Also Lizard Wizard might be dead.
